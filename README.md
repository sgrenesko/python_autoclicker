# python_autoclicker
A basic auto-clicker using python, works on desktops and windowed games. Only meant for single player games, as you might get banned if you use this on a public server so be warned!
When run, program asks the user for the time interval between clicks, and number of click events they want, then gives them 10 seconds to place the mouse where they want to click. Tested on Stardew Valley in borderless windowed mode, worked perfectly fine there!
